"""Mujoco Toolbox.
==============

A toolbox for working with MuJoCo simulations. This package provides various
utilities and controllers to facilitate a faster simulation process.

Modules
--------
- `Wrapper`: Contains the Wrapper class for interfacing with MuJoCo.
- `Controller`: Includes sineController, cosineController, and randomController
    for controlling simulations.
- `Builder`: Contains the Builder class for creating and merging MuJoCo models.
- `assets`: Contains pre-defined assets for building MuJoCo models.

Constants
----------
- CAPTURE_PARAMETERS: List of MjData fields to capture during simulation.

License
--------
This project is licensed under the `MIT License`. See the `LICENSE` file for details.

Notes
-----
This package is still under development. Report any issues to:
https://github.com/MGross21/mujoco-toolbox/issues.
